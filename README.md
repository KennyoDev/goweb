## Installing

To install, you will need:

Clone the Git repo and enter your config in the Python script.

Also, this is for Linux; that's why I set the PATH to local/bin.




## Basic usage

```

goweb youtube

```

This will open YouTube on Firefox.

More sites will be added by me, but you can also just do it yourself.

### With '-n' you can add a new Website:
```
goweb -n example example.com
